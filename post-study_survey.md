## Post-Study Survey

This is a test for evaluating your understanding on programming after a short tutorial, either in LOGO or PiE-LOGO. We will only use it for this user study and later research purpose. Please answer every question honestly and patiently. Thank you!

7. In this program, what happend?

clear the screen
Repeat the following for 4 times:
  Go forward 150 steps
  turn right
end the repeat

A. A square is drawn
B. A rectangle is drawn
C. A star is drawn
D. A diamond is drawn
E. I'm not sure
```

```
8. In this program, what happend?

clear
repeat 4 [
  fd 150
  right 90
]

A. A square is drawn
B. A rectangle is drawn
C. A star is drawn
D. A diamond is drawn
E. I'm not sure

```

```
9. Read these commands: (Apply to PiE-LOGO)

Define a function called square
	Repeat the following commands for 4 times
        Go forward 100 Steps        
        Turn left 90 degrees
    End the Repeat
End the function

Do the following for 12 times:
	call the function square
	turn left 30 degrees
end the repeat
  
What happend?
A. A square is drawn 12 times
B. The repeat pattern will be like a wheel
C. The side length of the square is 100
D. I am not sure
```

```
10. Followed 9, if I have a function named RandomColor which will randomly choose a color for the pen, where should I call the function if I want the color changed in every pattern? What if I want to change in every square?
```

```
11. Read these commands: (Apply to LOGO)

TO square
	REPEAT 4[
		FD 100
		LT 90
	]
END

REPEAT 12 [
